		<h1>Giant Pandas: Just The Worst </h1>
		<div>
			<p>
				Giant Pandas. These cuddly black and white bears found in southern China have been enacting a dark and not-so-secret conspiracy for thousands of years: total species suicide. Sound ridiculous, but as we dive into the facts and history of the Great Pandas (<i>quite the oxymoron</i>), we'll uncover ironclad evidence of their noble plot to rid the world of their awful presence, and touch upon the misguided human resistance preventing them from achieving their goal.

				Before beginning, we must take a moment and recognize that this plot <strong>solely belongs</strong> to the Giant Panda species, and does not include the cuter, and totally superior <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/5a/5d/52/5a5d52431ea19c03e5f4c0f3943ba52c.jpg">Red Panda</a> in any way. This distinction is crucial and must be understood before progressing.

			<p>Giant Pandas have been slowly bumping themselves off for generations on their Darwin-defying journey, but what evidence exists of this long con? Let's list the major points: 
				<ul>
					<li>Genetically, Giant Pandas are carnivores, yet they mostly eat bamboo, a plant completely lacking in major quantities of important nutrients.</li>
					<li>As a result of their dietary choices, Giant Pandas defecate up to <strong>40 times a day</strong>. No living thing wants to live if it must defecate 40 times a day.</li>
					<li>They refuse to reproduce. It takes at least 20 years before the dim flicker of sexual interest ignties in their brains, but even so, females are only "in heat" for three days a year. More on this later. </li>
					<li>If a Giant Panda manages to reproduce, the mother panda will commonly crush its offspring on "accident" with its great girth.  Are these really accidents?  Are they? We think not. </li>
				</ul>

			<p>While all Giant Pandas are deeply determined to acheive their long-term goal, the pandas' general incompetence gets in its own way.  </p>

				<ul>
					<li>They're inexpenseive.</li>
					<li>They're made for throwing at people.</li>
					<li>They're round and squishy.</li>
					<li>You can soak your enemies and leave them in a dripping state of <em>total humiliation!</em></li>

		<h2>How to make these small devices of drenching destruction</h2>
			<p>
				Luckily no permit is required. Follow the steps below:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Acquire water balloons. The more the better.</li>
					<li>Aqcuire water source, preferably an outside.</li>
					<li>Attach water balloon to nozzle.</li>
					<li>Fill balloon. Make sure to leave a small amount of air inside. This helps assure proper detonation.</li>
					<li>Tie the end of the balloon.</li>
					<li>Repeat as many times as you possibly can. This is an arms race.</li>
					<li>Revel in your new arsenal and picture your rivals bowing to you in cold puddles of defeat!</li>
				</ol>
