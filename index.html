		<h1>Giant Pandas: Just The Worst </h1>
		<div>
			<p>
				Giant Pandas. These cuddly black and white bears found in southern China have been enacting a dark and not-so-secret conspiracy for thousands of years: total species suicide. Sound ridiculous, but as we dive into the facts and history of the Great Pandas (<i>quite the oxymoron</i>), we'll uncover ironclad evidence of their noble plot to rid the world of their awful presence, and touch upon the misguided human resistance preventing them from achieving their goal.

				Before beginning, we must take a moment and recognize that this plot <strong>solely belongs</strong> to the Giant Panda species, and does not include the cuter, and totally superior <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/5a/5d/52/5a5d52431ea19c03e5f4c0f3943ba52c.jpg">Red Panda</a> in any way. This distinction is crucial and must be understood before progressing.

			<p>Giant Pandas have been slowly bumping themselves off for generations on their Darwin-defying journey, but what evidence exists of this long con? Let's list the major points: 
				<ul>
					<li>Genetically, Giant Pandas are carnivores. They have large pointed teeth, meant for ripping meat and their digestive system is not equipped for plant matter. Despite all of this, Giant Pandas mostly eat bamboo, a plant completely lacking in major quantities of important nutrients. So much so, that they must eat more than one species of bamboo or they quickly starve.</li>
					<li>As a result of their dietary choices, Giant Pandas defecate up to <strong>40 times a day</strong>. No living thing wants to live if it must defecate 40 times a day.</li>
					<li>They refuse to reproduce. It takes at least 20 years before the dim flicker of sexual interest ignties in their brains. However, the window for succesful reprodction is very short as females ovulate for only three days in an entire year. More on Panda sex later. </li>
					<li>If a Giant Panda manages to reproduce, typically twins are born. To instill the newborns with the goals of their species' great quest, the mother will often choose one to survive and the other to sacrifice itself for the cause. But even the surviving cub is not safe. Giant Panda mothers commonly crush their offspring on "accident" with their great girth.  Are these really accidents?  Are they? We think not. </li>
				</ul>
